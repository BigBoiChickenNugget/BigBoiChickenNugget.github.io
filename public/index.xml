      <description>What is Suckless? Suckless is a community of developers who create software that is designed to be minimalistic. They believe that software should be simple, small, and easy to understand. While at first glance this seems like a good idea, I would like to bring to attention both the flaws in their philosophy as well as the questionable nature of their community that prevents me from using their software regardless of its quality.</description>

      <description>I have a confession to make. I was an elitist when it came to technology. I used to judge individuals for their Apple devices and usage of proprietary programs.

As long as a tool works the way they want it to for their specific purpose, they are happy.</description>
