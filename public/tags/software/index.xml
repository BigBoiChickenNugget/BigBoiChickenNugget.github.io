      <description>What is Suckless? Suckless is a community of developers who create software that is designed to be, purposely, minimalistic. They believe that software should be simple, small, and easy to understand. While at first glance this seems like a good idea, I would like to bring to attention both the flaws in their philosophy as well as the questionable nature of their community that prevents me from using their software regardless of its quality.</description>
