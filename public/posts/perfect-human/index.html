    <h3 id="on-perfection-and-humanity">On Perfection and Humanity</h3>
<p>Quite recently, I&rsquo;ve been going through my old journals and trying to sift through a lot of the foolish ideas I had as a child.
One idea, which I still haven&rsquo;t reached a complete conclusion on, is what makes a human &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; While I, quite frankly, believe
that this is a foolish area of research and debate, since the literal definition of perfection is unattainable for all living beings,
I still think it&rsquo;s an interesting idea which is what prompted me to write a short mini-essay ono this topic.</p>
<h6 id="perfection-defined-in-an-engineering-sense">Perfection Defined in an Engineering Sense</h6>
<p>When we consider &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; in an engineering sense, we refer to the idea of a machine or system that is free of any and all defects.
That is, something that works with 100% efficiency and 0 loss of energy. While there may be other aspects that are capable of measuring
how &ldquo;good&rdquo; a design is, such as usability, design,and overall aesthetics, there is no unified definition of what makes these subjective
attributes &ldquo;defect free.&rdquo;</p>
<h6 id="perfection-for-living-beings">Perfection for Living Beings</h6>
<p>With this definition of perfection in a more technical and engineering setting, we now turn our attention to living beings. What does it
mean, for instance, for a frog to be perfect? Obviously, we can&rsquo;t say that a perfect frog is a being without defects, because then
we&rsquo;d essentially be saying a perfect frog is the same as, say, a perfect rat, which would be the same as a perfect human. To elaborate,
all living beings have the same goal: Live and breed on. However, with this definition, the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; living being would be one most
accomplished at the goal of both living and breeding. This means that to say that a perfect example of a living being (ie. a perfect frog,
a perfect rat, a perfect bird, etc.) is that exact creature without defects is to say that a perfect example of each living being is the
same as the perfect example of any other living being. This is since there must be one design that is optimized for the goal of living and breeding.</p>
<p>While this sounds confusing initially, essentially, my goal is the boil the idea of perfection in relation to living items down to two fundamental parts:
(1) living beings as a whole, and (2) examples of living beings. The former is the design that is able to accomplish the goal we have previously defined
for living beings, while the latter is an example of the perfect form of that living being. When I refer to the perfect form, I mean the form that
is most accurately able to represent that creature as a whole. For example, returning to a perfect frog, the perfect frog would be the most average frog with
our definition. To phrase this in a more understandable way, by studying a perfect frog, we&rsquo;d gain a perfect understanding of a frog. Given a frog
with defects missing, such as, say, greater intelligence to avoid predators (which accomplishes the goal), we&rsquo;d be studying an imperfect frog, but a
slightly more perfect overall being.</p>
<h6 id="perfection-for-humans">Perfection for Humans</h6>
<p>What this means in relation to humans is that the perfect human is the most average human. When we consider individuals to be superior or rank them
higher based on traits like height, looks, intelligence, etc., we are deviating from the perfect human. The perfect human has average height, average
looks, average intelligence, and overall a flat average individual.</p>
<h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
<p>What are you supposed to do with this? Absolutely nothing. Questioning what makes or doesn&rsquo;t make something perfect is a perfect example of a waste
of your time and resources. I did it so you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>In regards to rebuttals for what I&rsquo;ve said and areas of further thought, I lazily stated that the goal of living beings is to breed and live on, while this is
probably not the case. Also, my definition of perfection could very well be fought and turned over which would create a whole new argument. My purpose in
writing this was to try and better understand an idea that I came up with when I was younger.</p>
