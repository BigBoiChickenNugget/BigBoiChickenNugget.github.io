##### Essential Gist
Hi! I'm a second year mechatronics engineering student at McMaster University. At the moment, I'm working as a software developer at Taylor Systems. I'm passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and software development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. To contact me, simply shoot me an email at [talha05ahmad@gmail.com](mailto:talha05ahmad@gmail.com).
##### Areas of specialty
The skills that I have actively developed and applied through projects and / or work experience include:
- Software Development: Python, C, C++, some web development
- Embedded Systems: STM32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32
- Version Control: Git
- Other stuff that I'm too lazy to list

##### Dots
My setup is always undergoing changes, but at the moment the main softwares I use on a day to day basis are Arch Linux, Sway,
Waybar, Tmux, Neovim, and Alacritty. You can check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/BigBoiChickenNugget/dotfiles)
if you want to steal my config (I already stole a lot of it so I have no right to judge).
