##### Essential Gist
Hi! I'm a second year mechatronics engineering student at McMaster University. At the moment, I'm looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2025.

##### Areas of specialty
The skills that I have actively developed and applied through projects and / or work experience include:
- Software Development: Python, C, C++, some web development
- Embedded Systems: STM32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32
- Version Control: Git

##### Dots
My setup is always undergoing changes, but at the moment the main softwares I use on a day to day basis are Arch Linux, Hyprland,
Waybar, Tmux, Neovim, and Alacritty. You can check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/BigBoiChickenNugget/dotfiles)
if you want to steal my config (I already stole a lot of it so I have no right to judge).

##### Music
I sometiimes like to make low quality guitar videos on YouTube when I have free time (which is not very often) that you can find here: [Average Meta Elitist](https://www.youtube.com/@AverageMetalElitist/featured)
