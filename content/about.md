##### Essential gist
Hi! I'm a second year mechatronics engineering student at McMaster University. At the moment, I'm working as an embedded systems software developer at Taylor Systems. I'm passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and software development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. To contact me, simply shoot me an email at [talha05ahmad@gmail.com](mailto:talha05ahmad@gmail.com).
##### Areas of specialty
The skills that I have actively developed in applied through projects and / or work experience include:
- Software Development: Python, C, C++, some web development
- Embedded Systems: STM32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- Version Control: Git

##### Current Daily Driver
Currently, I daily drive an Arch machine with [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) as my window manager / compositor. I used to use [i3](https://i3wm.org/) before, but I switched to Hyprland because of its simplicity and ease of use (animations mainly). I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as my terminal emulator and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my text editor. I use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as my configuration manager. You can find my dotfiles at: [coming soon](#).

My current setup isn't complete, and while it helps me greatly, I'm always actively developing and building on it.
