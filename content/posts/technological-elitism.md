I have a confession to make. I was an elitist when it came to technology. I used to judge individuals for their Apple devices and usage of proprietary programs. Obviously,
while I still hold strong opinions on these products as a whole, I have come to understand that for most individuals it simply doesn't matter. As long as a tool works the way
they want it to for their specific purpose, they are happy. But first, let's start off with a definition of "technological elitism":

>Technological elitism is the belief that certain technologies are superior to others, and that those who use these technologies are more intelligent or capable than those who do not.

I think most of us in the Linux or FOSS community can relate to this definition. The main question is that remains is... *WHY*?
Why do we feel the need to judge other individuals based on what technologies they use in their day to day life? The most probable answer
is that, as engineers and developers, we tend to form entire personalities, or significant chunks of our personality, around the devices we use.
I've never seen an Apple fan rave about Apple devices every second of their life (apart from the superfans), but I have seen most individuals with
Pinephones never shut up about them. Similarly, Windows users never go on and on about how great Windows is compared to OSX, but Linux users
dedicate hours of their life to convincing others to switch to their distro of choice. If you need to dedicate so much of your life to convincing others
that the tool you use is better, is it really?

As an Arch user, it goes without saying that I want to flex my beautiful rice. From my waifu wallpaper to my catpuccin Alacrity theme, I want to show off.
But it's for this reason exactly that we're generally seen as insufferable. In fact, rather than switch to Linux, individuals make memes showing why Linux users
are awkward, really dumb, and overall losers. Moreover, rather than welcoming individuals to the community which we strive to do by showing off our setups
and going on and on about how dumb Windows and OSX users are in comparison to Linux users, a large number of individuals in the community are extremely toxic.
Any question by a newbie in the Arch forum is met with **"READ THE BLOODY MANUAL."** Is this really the community we pride ourselves with being part of?

###### How I Stopped Being an Elitist
Put simply, open your mind. That's the way to stop. Acknowledge that not everybody is you, and not everybody has the same needs as you. If someone is happy with
their Windows machine, let them be. If someone is happy with their iPhone, let them be. If someone is happy with their Pinephone, let them be. It's not your job to
convince them to switch to your tool of choice. If they want to switch, they will. If they don't, they won't. It's as simple as that. While I still have strong opinions
on some technologies (looking at you [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litigation_involving_Apple_Inc.#Consumer_class_actions)), I've come to understand that it's not 
my job to regulate the technologies other individuals use, and it isn't yours either!

Thanks for reading this idea.
