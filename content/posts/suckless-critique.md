###### What is Suckless?
[Suckless](https://suckless.org) is a community of developers who create software that is designed to be minimalistic.
They believe that software should be simple, small, and easy to understand. While at first glance this seems like a good idea,
I would like to bring to attention both the flaws in their philosophy as well as the questionable nature of their community that
prevents me from using their software regardless of its quality. 

But first, from their website, their philosophy is stated to be the following:
> Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our software projects.

###### Lack of Adherence to Philosophy
Not a bad idea, right? Well, when the actual software is seen, rather than following their philosophy, they seem to make software that is small in size
but complex to use. For example, DWM is a very minimalistic window manager; however, having to compile it from source each time you want to change a 
setting is not user-friendly. DWM is a great software that I've used in the past, however, using a more "sucky" software that is less minimal, like [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/),
is, I would argue, a far better experience and makes my life a lot easier.

My point with this is not to say that the Suckless community developers are wrong with their philosophy per se, because believing that software should
be simple and usable is a good idea (though not a universal one). My point is to raise the question of whether or not the software they create adheres to that philosophy?
Does their philosophy not imply that said minimal and usable software should be easy to use and understand? If so, then why does their behaviour with creating software
directly contradict that idea. Clearly, multiple softwares that are with their definition not minimal are much easier to use. I would argue that the developers on these projects
adhere to the Suckless philosophy more than Suckless themself. The problem is that the Suckless community is too busy looking at the code while not considering the most important
aspect: **the users**.

This brings me to my next point of why Suckless software is the way it is.

###### Elitism
If you haven't done so already, I recommend checking out my article on [elitism in technology spaces](https://talhahmad.me/technological-elitism). In that article, I discuss the idea of elitism
in the Linux and FOSS space mainly and how we can combat that. The Suckless community is a prime example of a group of individuals who believe themselves to be superior
simply due to them developing that type of software. While I don't deny that their software is used by many individuals, most of whom are probably not elitist, the core Suckless
group creates such software solely to stroke their own egos. While this seems to be a baseless accusation, it is rooted in evidence. Just look at the software itself! It is not friendly to use,
it isn't clean, and while the code seems to be simple, the experience most certainly isn't. What reason is there to create such stuff other than elitism but published under the guise of minimalism?

###### Neo-Nazi Behaviour
While these claims seem to be justified in criticizing the software, they are no reason for me to write a whole article on why individuals shouldn't be using Suckless. 
Every individual is gifted with the autonomy to choose what they'd like, and my only critique is that the software Suckless puts out isn't at all user friendly.
This means that individuals can still happily use Suckless software if they are comfortable with it.

The main reason I recommend avoiding this community like the plague is because their core community is filled with white supremacist Neo-Nazis.

The Suckless community has been known to organize [torchlit marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_procession#Marches_by_Far-right). Though [Anselm](https://garbe.ca/)
claims that the community is apolitical and isn't involved in any far right activities, the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. The Suckless community announced 
these [marches](https://suckless.org/conferences/2017/) suspiciously around the same time as the [Unite the Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) rally in Charlottesville.

There are plenty of other examples, and [Ben Harris](https://benharr.is/) has done a phenomenal job of linking a lot of these [incidents](https://tilde.team/~ben/suckmore/).

Please do some research on your own and, when you come to the realization that this community is not one you want to be a part of, I recommend looking at other alternatives.
